# Purchase Hooks - Components

Purchase hooks in this folder appear in the `Hooks Library` and can be chosen when creating a new product.

## How to add a hook

1. Add the hook contracts to the [contracts-hooks repo](https://github.com/slice-so/interface) with a PR
2. Open a PR adding a folder named like your purchase hook, containing:

- `{YourHook}.tsx`: The component displayed in the frontend
- `cloneInterface.json`: The interface of the factory contract used for your hook (after compiling the contracts in the `contracts-hooks` repo, you'll find it under `artifacts/contracts/hooks/{YourHook}/{YourHookFactory}.sol/{YourHookFactory}.json`)
- `index.ts`: Export component

3. Export component in `components/hooks/index.ts`

## How to write component

The component purpose is to

1. Hold the states necessary to execute the logic of the relative hook
2. Set the params correctly to

The exported object will need to have:

- `component`: The component to be rendered on page
- `label`: Text inside the hook card
- `description`: Short description of the hook
- `factoryAddresses`: List of deployments for each chainId (1 for ETH mainnet, 4 for Rinkeby)

> Hint: keep the component minimal and use the existing ones as reference, like [ERC20Gated](ERC20Gated/ERC20Gated.tsx) or [Allowlisted](Allowlisted/Allowlisted.tsx)

### Set params

The `params` object defines what happens when the user submits the form and creates the product. In your component props you have access to `setParams` to set it.

You can set 3 keys in the `params` object:

- `externalCall`: Defines the params of the purchase hook that will be called during purchase. In most cases, you can use `defaultExternalCall`.
- `deploy` (optional): If present, deploys and initializes the contract via a pre-deployed factory contract.
- `allowedAddresses` (optional): Addresses used on the frontend to generate from the connected account a Merkle proof verification and send it as `buyerCustomData` param.

See below the `Params` type as reference for the various fields

```ts
type Params = {
  externalCall: {
    data: BytesLike // `slicerCustomData` in purchase hook. Default: []
    value: BigNumberish // Wei amount to be sent to the contract. Default: 0
    externalAddress: string // Contract called upon purchase. Default: ZeroAddress
    checkFunctionSignature: BytesLike // Selector of function to call from the frontend to check requirements are met. Default: "0x95db9368"
    execFunctionSignature: BytesLike //  Selector of function called during product purchase. Default: "0xa23fffb9"
  }
  deploy?: {
    factoryAddresses?: { [chainId: number]: string } // Deployment addresses of factory contracts based on chainId
    abi: ContractInterface // factory contract abi
    args: any[] // Initialization params (excluding productsModule address and slicerId)
  }
  allowedAddresses?: string[] // Array of allowlisted addresses
}
```
